// Trees

// Terminlologies ->
// root - Topmost node
// parent - Node which connects to the child
// child - Node which is connected by another node is its child
// sibling - Nodes belonging to the same parent
// leaf/external - Nodes with no children
// internal - Nodes with atleast one child
// depth - No. of edges from root to that node
// height - No. of edges from that node to the deepest leaf
// degree - No. of direct children
// tree degree - highest degree of a node among all the nodes present in the tree
// Ancestors/descendants

// Binary Tree ->
// Tree which has atmost 2 children for all nodes
// Tree of degree <= 2 (Nodes can have 0,1,2 children)

// Tree - Non linear Data structure
// Array, stack, linked list, queue - Linear Data Structure

// Tree is ideal for representing hierarchial data
// ex. Filesystem, etc.

// Types of binary tree ->
// 1. Full or strict binary tree - All nodes have either 0 or 2 children
// 2. Perfect binary tree - Internal nodes have exactly 2 children + all leaf nodes are on the same level
// 3. Complete binary tree - All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level + last level must have its keys as left as possible
// 4. Degenerate tree - Every parent node has exactly one child
// 5. Left/Right Skewed Degenerate tree - all children are on the left/right side of the tree
